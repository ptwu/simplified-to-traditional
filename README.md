# Simplified to Traditional Converter

Using ChatGPT to accurately convert Simplified Chinese (zh-hans) -> to Traditional Chinese (zh-hant).

## Background

It might seem that converting simplified Chinese words and characters to traditional essentially
boils down to having some associative list or map of simplified character --> traditional character.
However, words can have a traditional counterpart, but the counterpart is context-dependent.

Consider "面" (miàn), which can mean "noodles", but can also mean "surface" or "face".

Traditional Chinese uses "麵" as a counterpart for only the "noodles" meaning, but if you directly
substitute that for every use of "面", you'll look weird. So clearly we need some more sophisticated
tools for this.

I made this as a tool to augment my Anki Chinese flashcards, but feel free to use the script however
you would like.
